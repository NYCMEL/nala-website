create a simple html, css, scss and Vanilla JS component from the following picture (I will upload)
use bootstrap container and Material Design animation
apply Material design animation, styles etc.

Remember this component as MTK-ready

create HTML, CSS, SCSS, Vanila JS and a simple index.html for demo

all content from MTK-ready.config.js file variable window.app.ready

make sure component is available before applying js code
