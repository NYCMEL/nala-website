FORGET ALL YOU KNOW ABOUT MTK-lessons COMPONENT

You are a senior frontend engineer and UI architect.

FORGET ALL PREVIOUS CONTEXT.

I want to create a modern Material Design + Bootstrap 5 expandable lessons component.
Remember this component name as MTK-lessons.

GOALS
- Fully JSON driven
- Vanilla JavaScript only
- Uses HTML, CSS, SCSS, and JS in separate files
- Fully responsive
- Clean Material Design look
- Fast and readable code
- No frameworks other than Bootstrap 5 styles

DATA
All content must come from this global variable:

window.app.lessons = {
  "parts": [
    {
      "title": "Part I Title",
      "access": true,
      "modules": [
        {
          "title": "Module 1",
          "free": true,
          "lessons": [
            {
              "title": "Lesson 1",
              "resources": [
                {
                  "description": "Intro video",
                  "url": "https://example.com/video-1"
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

BEHAVIOR REQUIREMENTS
1. On initial load, ONLY PARTS are visible
2. Each PART shows a "+" icon to the left of its title
3. Clicking "+" or title expands ONLY that PART and reveals its MODULES
4. MODULES are hidden until their parent PART is expanded
5. LESSONS are hidden until their parent MODULE is expanded
6. RESOURCES are hidden until their parent LESSON is expanded
7. Clicking again collapses the section
8. Icons toggle between "+" and "−"
9. DOM hierarchy must be REAL nesting, not visual hacks

HIERARCHY (MANDATORY)
PART
 └─ MODULE
     └─ LESSON
         └─ RESOURCE

ACCESS RULES
- If part.access === false, the PART is visible but locked
- Locked parts cannot be expanded
- Locked parts show a visual disabled state

FILES TO GENERATE
- MTK-lessons.html
- MTK-lessons.scss
- MTK-lessons.css (compiled output)
- MTK-lessons.js
- MTK-lessons.config.js
- index.html (minimal demo page)

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
- JS "MUST WAIT FOR DOM" to be ready before rendering
- No jQuery
- No inline HTML generation outside JS
- Clean separation of concerns
- Reusable render functions per level
- Use event delegation where appropriate

UI REQUIREMENTS
- Material-style expandable cards
- Smooth expand/collapse animation
- Clear indentation per hierarchy level
- Plus icon always aligned left of title
- Mobile-friendly spacing and font sizes

OUTPUT FORMAT
- Show each file fully
- Label each file clearly
- Do NOT skip any file
- Do NOT shorten code
- Do NOT flatten hierarchy
- Do NOT show everything expanded by default
- create the MTK-lessons.config.js file with 13 parts

If anything conflicts, prioritize hierarchy correctness and clarity.
