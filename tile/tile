Create a modern Material Design tile component named MTK-tile using HTML, CSS, SCSS, and vanilla JavaScript only.

MTK-tile behaves like a card with a title and HTML body.
It supports front and back sides with a smooth 3D flip animation.

All content AND background colors come from window.app.tiles.
Each tile mounts into a container with id "MTK-" + tiles[].id.

Front and back each define:
- title
- body (HTML string)
- bgColor (applied directly to that side)

Flip behavior:
- Hover flips to back
- Mouse out flips to front
- Click toggles flip for touch devices

Use Material Design styling:
- Rounded corners
- Elevation via box-shadow
- Smooth cubic-bezier animation

Deliver:
- HTML structure
- SCSS
- Compiled CSS
- Vanilla JS renderer
- Simple full index.html demo

No frameworks.
No em dash characters.
