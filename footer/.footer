ASSUMPTIONS
- Use Material Design styles and Bootstrap 5
- Use vanilla JavaScript only
- No frameworks

CORE REQUIREMENTS
- Component name: mtk-footer
- Dark mode background
- Located at the bottom of the page

LAYOUT
- Footer has two rows
- Row 1 contains five Bootstrap columns
  - brand column with logo and description below logo
- Row 2 contains two equal Bootstrap columns
  - Left side copyright text
  - Right side tagline or secondary text

BEHAVIOR
- Footer must stick to the bottom when page content height is smaller than viewport
- Footer must scroll naturally when page content exceeds viewport height
- Footer links must NOT navigate directly
- Footer links must publish navigation events using _pubsub.js

DATA AND CONFIGURATION

2. mtk-footer.html (container only or optional static structure)
3. mtk-footer.scss
4. mtk-footer.css (compiled from SCSS)
5. mtk-footer.js (production-ready vanilla JS)

JAVASCRIPT REQUIREMENTS
- Must wait for #mtk-footer to appear in the DOM before running
- Must wait for window.app.footer to exist before rendering
- Must dynamically create internal DOM structure if missing
- Must not assume script load order
- Must not throw errors if elements are missing
- Must use an IIFE to avoid polluting the global scope
- Must wire all links to _pubsub.publish(eventName)

DESIGN REFERENCE

- Match spacing, hierarchy, and column balance from the image

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
- Provide complete, copy-paste-ready code
- Code must be clean, readable, and production-ready
- Do not omit error handling
- Do not hardcode text in HTML
