I want to create a 2 column panels with bootstrap col-md-* coming from
app.panels[] JSON variable in MTK-panel.config.js file

Remeber this component as MTK-panel

Use material design animation on start.

<MTK-panel id="panel-1">
   HTML content is inline here...	   
</MTK-panel>

MTK-panel can have a background in JSON variable
MTK-panel can have an intial height and when content exceeds this height, over flow with scroll bar

left and right sides can have their own background colors

PANEL content is inline and not in json variable

left and right should overflow independent of one another and show scrollbar based on content height

remove all box shadows

use container and not container-fluid in template

left and right column widths from json variable as "col-md-??"

Create: SCSS, CSS, HTML, Vanilla js, samle variable, sample index.html file to show usage
