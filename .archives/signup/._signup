FORGET ALL YOU KNOW ABOUT MTK-signup and MTK-register and start all over

I want to create a modern Material Design signup form. Remember this component as MTK-signup.

MTK-signup form has 3 steps: all steps should have same size screen

1. General – get first name, middle initial, last name, email, repeat email.
   - Include helper text for each field.
   - Include a NEXT button.
   - NEXT button should only be enabled if all required fields are filled and valid.
   - Show inline error messages when required fields are empty or invalid.
   - Errors disappear automatically when the user types or changes input.
   - First name, Middle initial and last name should be on the same line

2. Contact – get phone and address.
   - Include helper text for each field.
   - Include NEXT and PREVIOUS buttons.
   - NEXT enabled only if required fields are filled.
   - Show inline error messages when required fields are empty or invalid.
   - Errors disappear automatically on input.

3. Optional – get age group and education level.
   - Include helper text for each field and clearly mark them as optional.
   - Include PREVIOUS and Submit buttons.
   - Submit generates a JSON object with all collected data and logs it to the console.
   - Optional fields never trigger validation errors.

Dropdown options:

- Age group:
  - Under 30
  - Under 50
  - Over 50
- Education:
  - High School
  - College
  - Advanced

Requirements:

- keep screen sizes same in between sections
- Must use Material Design + Bootstrap 5
- Large input fields with proper spacing
- Smooth animations for panel transitions
- Error messages should have explicit IDs, do not rely on nextElementSibling
- NEXT button must only be enabled when all required fields are filled
- JS should safely wait for the form element to exist in the DOM before adding event listeners (use a waitForElement helper or defer script)
- Vanilla JavaScript only, no jQuery
- Provide separate HTML, CSS/SCSS, and JS files
- Include step indicators showing current step
- JSON output must include all steps: general, contact, optional
- General, Contact, Optional shuld look more like a stepper
- next, previous and submit  buttons to stick to bottom center of MTK-signup card  and have same size
- Fully responsive and centered on screen
- Display General, Contact & Optional section labels on top of  MTK-signup with ">" betweein them, showing active section label and centered on top of the screen
- keep screen size same between section switches

Deliverables:

1. Full HTML file for MTK-signup
2. Full CSS/SCSS file for styling and Material Design animations
3. Full vanilla JS file for validation, step navigation, error handling, and JSON submission
4. Fully functional: Next/Previous buttons, validation, error messages, JSON submission
5. Safe JS initialization: no `null` errors or addEventListener issues
6. Optional fields never block Next/Submit
7. Error messages disappear as soon as user types
8. Ready to drop into any project
