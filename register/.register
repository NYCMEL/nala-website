i want to create a modern material design regiseration form
i want you to remember this component as _register

make a separate html, css, scss, vanilla js files

form should have the following fields:
- title: NALA Locksmith Registeration Form     
- First Name: label "First Name", helper:First Name, required
- Middle initial (labeled M.I.)
- Last Name: label "Last Name", helper:Lirst Name,required
- Email: label "Your Email", helper:example@example.com, required
- Email2: label "Repeat Email", required
- Phone number label "Contact Phone Number", helper:Phone Number, required

- Address2: label "Address", helper: Street Addresss Line 2, required

- City: label "City", helper:City, required
- State: label "State", helper: State, required
- ZipCode: label "Zip Code", helper:First Name, required
- Age: label "Age Group", required
  dropdown:
	Under 30
	Under 50
	Over 50

- Education Level: label "Education Level", required
  dropdown:
      High Scholl
     College
     Advanced

First Name, Middle Initial and Last Name on the same line 
City, State and Zipcode on same line

use _PubSub.js to publish all click events and include element ids

mark all required fields with a red "*"

if any field is empty, place the focus there on submit

disable submit button unless all fields have values

on submit publish a JSON file including all fields

all age and education dropdowns select the first option

in _register.js use PubSub and not _PubSub
