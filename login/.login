FORGET ALL YOU KNOW ABOUT MTK-login AND START OVER

I want to create an modern material design and bootstrap application login
I want you to remember this component as MTK-login

MTK-login is fully responsive
MTK-login labels float on field focus
MTK-login use material design and bootstrap 5.xx and it should be built with HTML, VANILLA JAVASCRIPT, CSS & SCSS
MTK-login has a title on the top
MTK-login should wait for elements to be loaded into DOM before proceeding

You should create CSS, SCSS, HTML, vanilla javascript and a minimal index.html in separate files
