FORGET ALL PREVIOUS CONTEXT for mtk-hierarchy
Create a reusable UI hierarchy named mtk-hierarchy using:
- HTML
- SCSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Bootstrap 5 (layout only)
- Modern Material Design & Styles
- Material Design icons
- Always create a JS class form mtk-component

Rules:
- mtk-hierarchy is wrapped in a <mtk-hierarchy class="mtk-hierarchy"> tag.
- mtk-hierarchy has a display:block
- The root element uses .mtk-hierarchy.
- All styles are scoped to .mtk-hierarchy.
- No global styles or IDs.
- publish click events using wc.publish
- subscribe to all 4-mtk-hierarchy events using wc.subscribe

Data:
- The hierarchy is JSON driven.
- Read config from window.app.hierarchy.
- ALL modules MUST have an "id" field
- ALL lessons MUST have an "id" field
- ALL resources MUST have an "id" field

Behavior:
- WAIT for element to be available inside DOM
- Use one namespace only: window.MTKHierarchy.
- When opening a lesson, all resources should be displayed on the RHS
- LHS and RHS must scroll independently (no page-level scrolling)
- LHS and RHS must fill 100% of parent height with overflow: auto

Restrictions:
- No frameworks.
- No jQuery.
- No Bootstrap JavaScript.
- No external libraries.
- ADA compliant CODE

Accessibility:
- Use semantic HTML.
- Keyboard accessible.
- Visible focus states.
- ADA compliant

Output, Create exactly four files:
- mtk-hierarchy.config.js (JSON FILE)
- mtk-hierarchy.scss
- mtk-hierarchy.html
- mtk-hierarchy.js

mtk-hierarchy UI structure:
- use nice material design elements
- Any and all border-radius should have a max value of 4px
- main screen has 2 sections, inside a bootstrap container
  A lhs (.mtk-hierarchy-lhs)
  A rhs (.mtk-hierarchy-rhs)
  lhs and rhs height should occupy 100% of parent element's height 
  lhs and rhs should have overflow auto (scrollable)
  lhs and rhs must scroll independently (each has its own scroll container)
  rhs:
    - col-md-8 (add a border)
    - can display a resizable, responsive video inside a <IFRAME> from link
    - display a set of images from link, one next to another and below the video (if any)
  lhs:
    - col-md-4 (add a border)
    - uses a structure like below as MODULES > LESSON > RESOURCE
	{
	    "title": "Introduction to Locksmithing",
	    "access": true,
	    "processed": false,
	    "modules": [
		{
		    "id": "module-1",
		    "title": "Foundations of Locksmithing",
		    "access": true,
		    "processed": true,
		    "lessons": [
			{
			    "id": "lesson-1-1",
			    "access": true,
			    "title": "Introduction",
			    "processed": true,
			    "resources": [
				{
				    "id": "resource-1-1-1",
				    "processed": true,
				    "access": false,
				    "type": "video",
				    "description": "Introduction to your instructor and the course",
				    "url": "https://vimeo.com/827172729"
				}
			    ]
			}
		...

lhs behavior:
  - all titles should be ellipsis with 100% width and show ...
  - modules and lessons and resources can be expanded. use folder & file icons for these
  - use "Card" for modules that contain all lessons and resources
  - opening a lesson should display all resources from that lesson on the rhs
  - opening a resource should display all contents from that lesson on the rhs
  - all resources accessed must have an "eye" icon on the right side of its title
  - resources have types video or photo
    - video should be displayed in an IFRAME
    - photos are placed horizontally one after the other below the video IFRAME
  - all click events should publish an event using wc.publish function

prototype:
  - create 5 elements in config file for MODULES, LESSON, RESOURCE and set all access=true & processed=true
  - show elements disabled if access=false 
  - automatically generate IDs for items that don't have them (fallback)
  - automatically set type='photo' for resources missing the type field

CSS Requirements:
  - Container must have overflow: hidden
  - Row must use flex-wrap: nowrap
  - Columns must have explicit height: 100%
  - LHS and RHS must each be independent scroll containers
  - Use flex: 1 1 auto for proper flex behavior

*** MUST USE MATERIAL DESIGN styles, colors, etc.
*** Use wc.js library for PubSub (wc.publish and wc.subscribe)
*** Config structure: window.app.hierarchy = [ { courses } ]
*** IMPORTANT: All modules need "id", all lessons need "id", all resources need "id"
*** CRITICAL: LHS and RHS must scroll independently with no page-level scrolling

update hierarchy.js file as follows:
add quiz link at the end of each module lessons
if item has access=false it should be disabled and
disable modules when access=false
when "mtk-lesson__title" is clicked enable the next "mtk-lesson__title" and
if it is the last "mtk-lesson__title", enable quiz link
