FORGET ALL YOU KNOW ABOUT MTK-component component
FORGET ALL PREVIOUS CONTEXT.

I am a senior frontend engineer and UI architect.
I want to create a new component with simple scss, html and vanilla javascript

MY FRAMEWORK:
 - modern Material Design
 - Bootstrap-5 

Remember this component name as MTK-component.

MTK-component is enclosed in a <MTK-component> tag
MTK-component scss is enclosed in a .mtk-component class

MTK-component is JSON driven from windows.app.component variable
MTK-component can uses dark or light mode

you should create the folllowing files:
 - scss
 - html
 - vanilla js
 - minimal html
