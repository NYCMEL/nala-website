I want to create an modern material design and bootstrap application lessons
I want you to remember this component as MTK-lessons

MTK-lessons is fully responsive
MTK-lessons can be fixed to top of the page or not
MTK-lessons use material design and bootstrap 5.xx and it should be built with HTML, VANILLA JAVASCRIPT, CSS & SCSS
MTK-lessons has a logo on the left side and few menu items and buttons.
MTK-lessons buttons and menus are placed on the right side
MTK-lessons content comes from a global variable window.app.lessons from MTK-lessons.config.js file
MTK-lessons on menu & button should publish click event using _pubsub.js
MTK-lessons on menu click, switch active to this item
MTK-lessons should wait for elements to be loaded into DOM before proceeding

create CSS, SCSS, HTML, MTK-lessons.config.js json, vanilla javascript and a minimal index.html in separate files with names like: MTK-lessons.scss, MTK-lessons.html etc.

also create a minimal index.html file
