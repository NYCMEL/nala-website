FORGET ALL PREVIOUS CONTEXT for mtk-settings
Create a reusable UI component named mtk-settings using:
- HTML
- SCSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Bootstrap 5 (layout only)
- Modern Material Design, Material Design icons and styles
- Always create a JS class for mtk-settings and initialize it inside the JS file itself
Rules:
- The component is wrapped in a display:block element <mtk-settings class="mtk-settings">.
- The root element uses .mtk-settings.
- All styles must be scoped to .mtk-settings.
- No global styles or IDs.
- publish click events using wc.publish
- subscribe to all 4-mtk-settings everns using wc.subscribe
- create a onMessage function to be passed to wc.subscribe function
Data:
- The component is JSON driven.
  - any and all data must come from mtk-settings.config.js file
Restrictions:
- No frameworks.
- No Bootstrap.
- No external libraries.
- Vanilla Javascript
Accessibility:

Output! Create exactly these files:
- mtk-settings.config.js (JSON FILE)
- mtk-settings.scss
- mtk-settings.html
- mtk-settings.js
Behavior:
- MUST WAIT for element to be available inside DOM, since i will be using <wc-include> for dynamic inclusion
- all published (wc.publish) messages should be logged using wc.log to console before being published
I want to create a simple profile/settings page
requirements:
  - show user name (first, middle initial and last name) as read only
  - show and mask current password and allow update, by clicking a "Update" button to
    enable editing of the password. once the user changes password, there should be
    a second input to re-enter the new password
  - new and repeat passwords, must be the same before "save".
  - If not the same, error message and focus should be in the new password
